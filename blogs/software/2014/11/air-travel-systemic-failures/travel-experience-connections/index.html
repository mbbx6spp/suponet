          <h2>Air Travel Systememic Failures</h2>
          <h5 class="time"></h5>
          <h2>In-flight Travel Experience &amp; Connection</h2>
<p>
  The experience wasn't all bad. In terms of end result it was actually
  ideal. The problems I highlighted regarding seat assignment and checkin
  lockout adversely impacted victims of process and/or software bugs are
  significant. I think they should be address very quickly by American
  Airlines, but the in-flight travel experience and connection experience
  was very good. Generally.
</p>
<h3>Punctuality</h3>
<p>
  For me the delay in arriving into ORD wasn't impactful. My connection
  was only tight for me because I needed to get a seat assignment at
  the gate, but I didn't need to run there. However, we left from CMI
  significantly later (even though we were on the plane on time).
</p>
<h3>Connection Priority</h3>
<p>
  The first leg of my trip was interesting when we were deplaning because
  it was the first time I had heard the flight attendant request that
  other passengers on the flight let the Cleveland passenger out first
  as their connection was very agressive with the delay.
</p>
<p>
  This was great to see happen. I have previously been in this situation
  before but that never happened for me. I ended up missing my connection to
  SFO that day.
</p>
<p>
  One day you may need this priority. So don't whine about someone at the back
  needing deplaning priority. Instead embrace it. We are all in this together.
</p>
<p>
  What was even better about this (I thought) was that the airline/flight
  attendant knew this was the case. They are starting to monitor connections
  of passengers to streamline critical connections first. I think? Maybe I am
  wrong though. If it is the case though, then this is putting the passenger
  first.
</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Improvements</h3>
<p>
  I do however have a suggestion to make this new practice better for all
  involved.
</p>
<p>
  First off, the flight attendant should know where these passengers are
  located and inform all rows 10 and lower to let the passenger from 10C out
  first. Not just "please let the Cleveland connection passenger out first".
  I have no knowledge of where the Cleveland passenger is located. Make it
  easier for other passengers to follow the directives. I had been putting my
  laptop away in my bag when the passenger from Cleveland walked past me
  so I didn't know I was no longer waiting on him/her to pass until I asked
  a neighboring passenger when everyone else was standing up.
</p>
<p>
  If the critical connection passenger has valet baggage, prioritize it for
  them, or this is all moot.
