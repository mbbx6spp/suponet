%h3 Qualifications: Who The Hell Are You To Criticize?

%p
  An exceptionally fair question, so let me talk about the limitations of my
  qualifications as I attempt to dissect the problems I experienced:

%ul
  %li I have never worked for an airline in any capacity
  %li I have never worked for an airport in any capacity
  %li
    I haven't researched this space thoroughly (yet) from a business
    process and systems perspective
  %li
    I can only guess what the behind the scenes constraints and limitations
    are for a behemoth airline like American Airlines

%p
  So judge this content considering the above. Correct me where I am wrong,
  or have made invalid assumptions. Tell me why because I would love to know
  more.

%p
  As mentioned I am not an expert in airline business or travel industry. I
  am however a higher frequency than average air traveler (for both business
  and personal). Let me quantify this for transparency. In the last 12 months:

%ul
  %li
    I have made one international round trip consisting of 4 legs of travel.
  %li
    I have made eleven domestic (US) round trips to four different
    destinations with typically four legs of travel each roundtrip.
  %li
    One trip was a multi-leg trip to two different US destinations over the
    two weeks.
  %li
    Two of these round trips were for personal purposes. The rest business.
  %li
    Most trips were from the midwest (my home local airport of CMI) to major
    west coast airports. One was from CMI (through ORD) to LGA (east coast).
  %li Most connections were through ORD. At least one was through DFW.
  %li Most of these legs were via American Airlines or a subsidiary/partner.
  %li
    At least four of these trips had weather related delays which are not
    considered as failures of the airline. However, the way they respond
    to external failure can be a failure. When a datacenter or router
    goes out, you need to figure out what the response is and you need
    to do this before it becomes reality. Users of your service and hosted
    solutions do not care that one of your partners lost power and didn't
    have the power redundancy they advertized. They just don't. Respond
    and care about how your respond. Shit happens, but...have a professional
    response to customers.

%p
  %em
    Note: I am by no means a travel warrior, but I am not an irregular nor
    infrequent air traveler. Now you can assess how you should judge this
    content at least.

%p
  Another qualification (I think) is that I am a software engineer who has
  designed and evolved various distributed systems (software)
  applied to a number of domains. This may not seem pertinent to many however
  I suggest it is relevant in the sense that I understand systems design in a
  much more abstract, theoretic but also practical and visceral way than many
  other passengers. For example, not only do I design these systems, I have
  been on call for them and woken up at 4am for all kinds of problems and
  severities.

%p
  When I arrive at an airport to start my journey, or when I am waiting at an
  airport between flights (connecting), boarding, deplaning, collecting
  baggage (valet or claim), or leaving the airport (ground transport) I see
  systems and processes that are connecting people, baggage, and places. I
  can see the implications of queuing theory - something I have to know for
  my job to initially design, understand, troubleshoot, and tune software
  systems - on airport, security, and airline procedures.

%p
  I have previously thought it would be great to write a book/paper/series
  of blog posts/articles on parallels between software design and runtime
  characteristics under loads or security breaches and air travel under such
  conditions. This is just how my mind works. I love this kind of stuff.

%p
  I am probably over simplifying some of what I will write in this series.
  I am writing in haste to get something out there and show I am interested
  in providing constructive feedback now that my anger and frustrations as
  a passenger have subsided from these experiences. Talk to me. Tell me
  what logical errors or problematic assumptions I have made about the
  systemic issues I perceived as a passenger only seeing one side of it.

%p
  I welcome the feedback. Always.

%h3 The Good

%h4 In-flight Experience

%p
  It's not all bad. Some of the legs and even a couple of roundtrips I have
  had zero significant issues. Most of my in-flight experiences have been
  more than tolerable, some were even enjoyable. Most of the time gate and
  flight attendant staff are professional, courteous, fulfilling their
  intended role, and helpful.


%h4 Mobile App

%p
  I am enjoying the new improvements to the American Airlines mobile app,
  which now include some (limited, but some) metrics on delays of that
  flight. It even specifies the context bounds of these metrics making
  the metrics reported actually meaningful. Thanks for this! It also now
  includes the upstream flight that provides the aircraft. I will talk more
  about why this is valuable as a passenger in my tips for passengers
  post.

%h3 Context

%p
  My experience is probably some of the worst experienced by American
  Airlines by virtue of being based out of the CMI local airport. Why?
  It only has connection flights to two major hubs: ORD and DFW. According
  to a report BLA BLA (need to cite source here) these are the two
  "worst" airports for delays and cancelations in the whole of the US.

%p
  Having said that, as a passenger, in-flight, I am pretty low fuss.
  I typically travel alone (I haven't flown with the kids in the last twelve
  months, but know this will change over new year:(). I am fully able
  bodied and I do not make a fuss about most things. I am almost always
  willing to take the crappiest seat (based on what many consider desireable
  features) just to be sure I am on the flights I expect to be on. I
  do not call the attendants and ask for extra things or anything like that.
  I don't try to game the system for the "best seats" or try to jump
  ahead of people before my boarding group's turn. I am also almost never
  late to the gate (except for bad/delayed connections). i.e. other
  passengers aren't waiting for me.

%h3 Scope

%p
  There are so many processes, procedures, and systemic failures and how I
  could suggest improvements in the air travel industry and there are actually
  many, much more well versed experts that intimately understand the problems
  technically and practically than I do. This series of posts is limited to
  suggesting improvements or highlighting high frustration points that
  could be isolated, managed (expecations), or removed complete from the
  below mentioned sub-posts.

%h3 Dissecting the problems

%p
  To attempt to address some of the concerns and provide constructive and
  hopefully meaningful suggestions for improvement I am going to separate
  the posts to address specific parts of the problem.

%p
  Here is my first cut at the dissection of the whole experience:

%ul
  %li
    %a{ :href =&gt; "/blogs/software/2014/11/air-travel-systemic-failures/gate-seat-assignments/"}
      Exposing internal processes to impact certain passengers negatively (plus "bugs")
  %li
    %a{ :href =&gt; "/blogs/software/2014/11/air-travel-systemic-failures/travel-experience-connections/"}
      In-flight experience and connection process improvements (good and bad)
  %li
    %a{ :href =&gt; "/blogs/software/2014/11/air-travel-systemic-failures/overbooking/"}
      Double- or over- booking seats on flights (suggestions to reduce
      passenger frustration and possibly even out demand/load on flights)
  %li
    %a{ :href =&gt; "/blogs/software/2014/11/air-travel-systemic-failures/customer-service-suggestions/"}
      Suggestions for American Airlines on customer service
  %li
    %a{ :href =&gt; "/blogs/software/2014/11/air-travel-systemic-failures/passenger-tips/" }
      Tips for other passengers to reduce your steps based on what I now know
