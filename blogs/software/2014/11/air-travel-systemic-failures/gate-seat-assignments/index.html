          <h2>Air Travel Systemic Failures</h2>
          <h5 class="time"></h5>
          <h2>Gate Seat Assignments</h2>
<p>
  This part of the series on US air travel systemic failure is regarding my
  pre-flight experience which I believe was the most frustrating experience
  as a passenger (for pre-flight experience) that I have ever had.
</p>
<p>
  See the <a href="/blogs/software/2014/11/air-travel-systemic-failures/">general
  overview post on the good, the context and the other problems/sources of
  improvement</a> that I identified of my
  experience over the last 48 hours of air travel experince with American
  Airlines.
</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>Let first talk about what happened and the look at what it all means.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Three weeks ago I booked my flight leaving Nov 16th via the booking
    system my employer requires we use. After purchasing the ticket I
    reserved my seats on the flights (or so I thought).
  </li>
  <li>
    On Saturday Nov 15 I woke up at 6am to checkin to my flight for the
    next day starting at 6am.
  </li>
  <li>
    I attempted to check in via the mobile app 8 or so times and received
    an error message.
  </li>
  <li>
    I tweeted at @AmericanAirlines asking if there was a problem with
    checkin. This is where the confusion and frustration began.
  </li>
  <li>
    They responded saying due to an equipment change I wouldn't be able
    to checkin for my flight until I went to the airport.
  </li>
  <li>
    I had no idea what they meant by equipment change (they didn't explain).
    Then I realized my seat assignment on the first leg of the trip was
    on a seat that didn't exist in the flight seat plan. I tweeted to
    them about that and asked how I could get seats assigned. At this point
    it was almost 24 hours in advance of the journey but within the checkin
    period.
  </li>
  <li>
    They informed me that the seat assignments were under "airport control".
  </li>
  <li>
    I asked clarification on what this meant a few times. They didn't directly
    address my concerns.
  </li>
  <li>
    They then asked me to send them my record locator over DM. I did. Their
    response (after denying AA double books flights) was to transfer me to
    a less reliable flight (statistically speaking) via DFW that got me in 50+
    minutes later into SFO.
  </li>
  <li>
    This drove me nuts. They had denied double booking the flight but
    conveniently the only way they would allow me to confirm my seats on a
    flight was transferring me to a much less reliable and less desireable
    connection time window at DFW that got me in almost an hour later.
  </li>
  <li>
    At this point I called the partner travel site my employer requires we use
    to see if they could confirm my seats for me. After two calls (the
    agents were both perfectly nice and helpful) I realized I was put at a
    significant disadvantage despite already haven't reserved my seats weeks
    ago. The first leg of the flight was on a seat that didn't exist on
    the aircraft and the second leg was now showing as "unassigned". :(
  </li>
  <li>
    I arrived at the airport at 5am to checkin. I was told I had to go to
    the gate after security to get a seat assignment.
  </li>
  <li>
    I got to the gate waited a while and then the agent printed me out
    a ticket with seat assignment for the first leg only. I asked about
    the second leg and told the agent how I had booked weeks ago and
    reserved the seat upon booking but the initial response was,
    "you need to get your seat assigned at the gate".
  </li>
  <li>
    I did voice my great displeasure as I was told by @AmericanAir the
    previous day I could get my seats assigned when I checked in at the
    airport.
  </li>
  <li>
    Eventually (in a very nice and unexpected way) the agent printed
    me out the ticket for the second leg with a seat assignment and
    handed it to me very discretely after the conversation had ended.
  </li>
  <li>
    Thank you, gate agent! You saved me wasting lots of my time in ORD and
    being effectively stranded until "space" could be found on a subsequent
    flight.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Observations &amp; Evidence</h3>
<p>
  You might be wondering what made me think I wouldn't get on the flight
  because @AmericanAir claimed there would be no problem the day before on
  Twitter. So here is a short catalog of some of the signs that if it wasn't
  for the first gate attendant I would have been stranded in ORD until some
  unknown availability on a much later flight.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>My checked baggage at the destination had a tag saying "standby".</li>
  <li>The second leg of the flight (from ORD to SFO) had no empty seats.</li>
  <li>There was a wait list for the second flight to SFO.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In a nutshell, I think when @AmericanAir <em>assures</em> you about
  anything in the future about your chances of anything, you should
  question it.
</p>
<h3>The Bugs</h3>
<p>
  Ok, I can see a few bugs in the system (software and process).
</p>
<p>
  Firstly, if a passenger books and then reserves seats for a flight they
  should never be unassigned or assigned invalid (non-existent) seats.
  Or if this should be allowed then airlines need to provide full
  disclosure of when this might happen and how they will notify
  impacted passengers.
</p>
<p>
  Secondly, it should never be possible to assign a non-existent seat
  for a flight. That's just a plain software bug but potentially a big
  problem for both the passenger and the airline.
</p>
<p>
  Thirdly, this checkin lock out process should have a clearer set of
  rules defined so that the experience is more consistent for passengers.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, there should be fair warning that those without assigned seats
  and what the implications are (I knew full well which is why I got
  frustrated with being locked out of checkin until potentially it would
  have been too late for me).
