          <h2>Five Signs Your TechOps Organization Is Doing It Wrong</h2>
          <h5 class="time"></h5>
          <p>
  This is a collection of troubling signs that I have witness in a variety of
  clients and employers over my career. Let's see what we can learn from them.
</p>
<h3>1. Infrastructure as a Jira Ticket (IaaJT)</h3>
<p>
  If you, as an engineer or SRE, need to create a new Jira ticket to have VMs
  or baremetal servers provisioned by a specific team in your organization
  then management has done something horribly wrong.
</p>
<p>
  This demonstrates a lack in understanding of technical
  operations in the 21st century which differs dramatically in terms of
  scale, priorities (distributed uptime, not node uptime), economics, and
  complexity.
</p>
<p>
  Software services are no longer limited to tens or even hundreds of servers
  in one datacenter, in the same or adjacent racks. As such we must emphasize
  the importance of on-demand infrastructure for our <em>customers</em>. This
  should not be news to anyone who has read any industry news or opinion in
  the last fifteen years.
</p>
<p>
  Competitors are doing this in public clouds and perhaps even in-house. This
  is not an advantage for a company now, it's a basic necessity.
</p>
<p>
  An organization that bottlenecks infrastructure requests (virtual or
  physical) for provisioning in even a semi-automated process (but still
  requires gatekeepers) cannot enable innovation, experimentation, or take
  advantage of the ecnomomies of virtualization and on-demand infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
  Is this salvagable? Perhaps. Give someone who has the initiative, technical
  capacity the resources they need to pay down the debt service and principal
  on the lack of automation. Do not punt on this. Find the person that is
  committed to fixing the issue with clear purpose and driven innovate not
  just catch up. If this kind of person can't be enabled in such an
  organization, then good luck. That is indicative of a culture deficit,
  which is the hardest kind of problem to solve.
</p>
<h3>2. If Hardware Ordering Is Chaotic</h3>
<p>
  This applies to organizations that manage actual hardware and
  the procurement process, however, could be applied to ensuring your AWS/cloud
  account limits are sensible as an on-going concern. Perhaps via metrics.
  How progressive. (Some may say necessary.) When orders go "missing", nobody
  can find out where their hardware orders are months later, or you are
  constantly hitting AWS/cloud account limits this indicates a troubling
  administrative oversight.
</p>
<p>
  Management action is needed to rectify this problem. The changes should be
  straight-forward assuming no foul/fraud play here. Put a simple organization
  structure and process in place so that orders can be tracked. Have a simple
  set of steps to allow anyone in the organizaation to request new hardware
  when they need it and the requirements for justification. This should be
  documented, simply. Without fanfare and broadly accessible throughout the
  organization. Tracking of hardware should be transparent to as many people
  in the organization as possible to prevent potential abuse (of varying
  degrees).
</p>
<p>
  If these changes aren't made this reality will continue to add frustration,
  burn unnecessary cycles and increase time to delivery. Creating a
  wasteful and inefficient organization that isn't
  <a href="/blogs/software/2014/11/responsive-enterprises-mealy-machines-hacker-way/">responsive to the current state of the world externally and internal state</a>.
</p>
<h3>3. Management Devalues Automated Checks And Balances</h3>
<p>
  Imagine an organization with tens of thousands of machines (virtual and
  physical) that doesn't validate even the syntax of Puppet manifests in
  a CI/CD feedback loop or thinks it does not constitute a compelling
  business case to spend time on automating. That TechOps organization is
  absolutely doing it wrong.
</p>
<p>
  Now imagine an operations engineer that only creates stub `precommit`,
  `commit`, and `deploy` CI/CD callback script in a new repository merely
  to check the boxes in a check list. This is someone that just does not
  understand the value of managing risk in evolving codebases. This person's
  professional experience may have only consisted of writing one-off scripts
  and never needing to revisit them again when times [infrastructures] were
  simpler [orders of magnitude smaller]. This operations engineer has not
  learned the value of checks and balances as an anti-entropy mechanism.
  They do not truly consider Infrastructure as [Delcarative] Code. The
  culture has failed to teach him.
</p>
<p>
  The key here is the technical leaders of TechOps must be competent enough to
  articulate the importance of check and balances to decision makers.
  They should also have a good idea about which checks and balances provide
  more ROI and have effective project management support to drive the changes.
  However, all bets are off on fixing this fundamental issue if technical
  leadership doesn't exist at all or the competence of those who win
  political battles is in question. Those are examples of toxic environments.
</p>
<h3>
  4. Nobody Has Pride
</h3>
<p>
  There are several shops where I have experienced this both on the ops
  and the engineering side.
  When engineers do not have pride in their work product it
  reduces code quality and makes the maintenance of your infrastructure
  (which is now codified in, you know, Infrastructure as Code) significantly
  harder. From a business perspective it also directly impacts time to
  delivery making the product offering less competitive. The harder it is to
  maintain code because of low quality the  lower the morale on the team is
  and the harder it is to add new features or fix bugs. Both adversely impact
  delivery times negatively.
</p>
<p>
  So what is the purpose of a set of conventions? The team has to all agree
  to a set of conventions and guidelines that they are willing to write
  code in. It doesn't have to be in great depth but the constraints of the
  codebase have to be defined, preferrably in written form. It can be a simple
  list of dos and donts in markdown inside your repository. It doesn't have to
  be a 20 page, beautifully typeset, paper. In fact, if you spend
  time on that part you are probably doing it wrong too. Just in a totally
  different way. :)
</p>
<p>
  So now we come to why coding conventions and style guidelines matter, even
  in technical operations codebases? Because the team has to come together
  and agree and duke it out and agree to disagree. Code conventions are
  there to provide a common understanding for a *team*, not to have the
  lead architect dictate his/her personal preferences. It's to build some
  kind of consensus. Choose constraints that the team believes is valuable for
  the current codebase. You may decide to have a standard Ruby set of
  conventions for all Ruby code in your organization, but on one project you
  might make minor overrides to the standard because of the type of codebase
  it might be. Perhaps it's a crypto/security library and some extra
  constraints would be important because of how the Ruby bindings interface
  with the native C code. (That example may or may not make sense.)
</p>
<p>
  With one mind and agreement a team can work together and not constantly
  fight with each other over minor details that in the grand scheme of things
  don't really matter.
</p>
<blockquote>
  All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
</blockquote>
<p>
  All families (or teams) must make compromises to continue functioning well.
  The agreement on code conventions and/or styleguides plus the changes
  workflow itself should be documented, well defined, and easy to update when
  needed.
</p>
<p>
  Things happen. People join and people leave. Treat the team's agreement
  as a living document and set of principles to adhere by. Talk
  about things at lunch some times. What irks you about the conventions, why?
  How would you change it? Make a case to the rest of the team. Decide. As a
  team. More times than not this will reveal how unimportant these
  details actually are. It also encourages discourse on what constitutes
  code quality on a low level and getting engineers to understand why
  some conventions and guidelines were put in place.
</p>
<p>
  The changes workflow (e.g. git and/or release workflow, etc.) needs to be
  well defined and documented. Unless it is contraversial, I don't think
  the initial agreement has to be democratically elected because that might
  take a while.
</p>
<p>
  As an initial step, I strongly suggest you use the default language code
  style guidelines when creating new teams and/or codebases. Then iterate.
  Otherwise you will spent an enternity arguing over an empty canvas. If
  there are multiple, put the top three already existing public ones up for a
  vote to the team. But make sure it is a living document that can be
  updated and revisited when a case is made. The key is that team members
  must feel the ability to change things and not be stuck with antiquated
  restrictions if that happens to become the case. Hungarian notation comes
  to mind from my C++ days, as an example! :)
</p>
<h3>5. People Are Burned Out</h3>
<p>
  There are potentially many reasons for this, but the root cause is usually
  ineffective executive management who constantly fail to drive meaningful
  changes through their organization. Instead what is common is buzzword
  bingo during All Hands meetings and empty promises that are never delivered
  on.
</p>
<p>
  When this happens you can see management decisions are not based on
  meaningful metrics; these are discarded in favor of pomp and fanfare
  numbers without context to drive decisions. Decisions based on their deep
  seated biases knowingly or not.
</p>
<p>
  This is the biggest problem in this list. Without cleaning house at the very
  top, nothing can fix this. Executives must believe that using metrics
  meaningfully with context and not just for the gamification of their peons
  against each other is a valuable proposition that will lead to a more
  effective organization with less headaches (for them).
</p>
<p>
  As noted by a coworker I need to present a compelling case for a small
  set of metrics that could be used.
