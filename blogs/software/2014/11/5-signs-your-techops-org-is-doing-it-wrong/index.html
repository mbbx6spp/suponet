          <h2>Five Signs Your TechOps Organization Is Doing It Wrong</h2>
          <h5 class="time"></h5>
          <h3>1. Infrastructure as a Jira Ticket (IaaJT)</h3>
<p>
  If you, as an engineer or SRE, need to create a new Jira ticket to have VMs
  or baremetal servers provisioned by a specific team in your organization
  then management has done something horribly wrong.
</p>
<p>
  This demonstrates a complete lack in understanding of technical
  operations in the 21st century which differs dramatically in terms of
  scale, priorities (distributed uptime, not node uptime), and complexity.
</p>
<p>
  Is this salvagable? Perhaps. When someone does take initiative to attempt
  to solve the automation problem, has the technical capacity, and is given
  the resources (time and/or other people) then hopefully those people aren't
  shot down due to turf wars. If on the other hand, they are, then good luck.
  You'll need it.
</p>
<h3>2. If Hardware Ordering Is Chaotic</h3>
<p>
  This mostly applies to organizations that manage actual hardware and
  the procurement process, however, could applied to ensuring your AWS/cloud
  account limits are sensible as an on-going concern. When orders go
  <em>"missing"</em>, nobody can find out where their hardware orders are
  after months, or you are constantly hitting AWS/cloud account limits this
  indicates a troubling administrative oversight.
</p>
<p>
  When this becomes the rule and not the exception, big action is needed by
  those in charge. Or it will not get better, adding frustration and wasted
  time to what will become an even more burned out org (see the last part).
</p>
<h3>3. Management Has Disdain For Automated Checks And Balances</h3>
<p>
  Imagine an organization with tens of thousands of machines (virtual and
  physical) that doesn't validate even the syntax of Puppet manifests in
  a CI/CD feedback loop or thinks it does not constitute a compelling
  business case to spend time on automating. That TechOps organization is
  absolutely doing it wrong.
</p>
<p>
  Now imagine an operations engineer that only creates stub `precommit`,
  `commit`, and `deploy` CI/CD callback script in a new repository merely
  to check the boxes in a check list. This is someone that just does not
  understand the value of managing risk in evolving codebases. This person's
  professional experience may have only consisted of writing one-off scripts
  and never needing to revisit them again when times [infrastructures] were
  simpler [orders of magnitude smaller]. This operations engineer has not
  learned the value of checks and balances as an anti-entropy mechanism.
  They do not truly consider Infrastructure as [Delcarative] Code. The
  culture has failed him.
</p>
<p>
  The key here is the technical leaders of TechOps must be competent to
  understand the importance of check and balances, should also have a good
  idea about which checks and balances provide more ROI and have effective
  project management support to drive the changes. However, all bets are
  off on fixing this fundamental issue if technical leadership doesn't
  exist at all or the competence of those who win political battles is in
  question.
</p>
<h3>
  4. Nobody Has Pride
</h3>
<p>
  There are several shops where I have experienced this both on the ops
  and the engineering side. This is a problem. When this is the case there is
  no pride in the work product from people or teams. This directly
  reduces the code quality and makes the maintenance of your infrastructure
  (which is now codified in, you know, code) significantly harder. From a
  business perspective it also directly impacts time to delivery. The harder
  it is to maintain code because of low quality the lower the morale on the
  team is and the harder it is to add new features or fix bugs. Both adversely
  impact delivery times negatively.
</p>
<p>
  So what is the purpose of a code convention? The team has to all agree
  to a set of conventions and guidelines that they are willing to write
  code in. It doesn't have to be in great depth but the constraints of the
  codebase have to be defined, preferrably in written form. It can be a simple
  list of dos and donts in markdown inside your repository. It doesn't have to
  be a 20 page, beautifully typeset, paper. In fact, if you spend
  time on that part you are probably doing it wrong too. Just in a totally
  different way. :)
</p>
<p>
  So now we come to why coding conventions and style guidelines matter, even
  in technical operations codebases? Because the team has to come together
  and agree and duke it out and agree to disagree. Code conventions are
  there to provide a common understanding for a *team*, not to have the
  lead architect dictate his/her personal preferences. It's to build some
  kind of consensus. Choose constraints that the team believes is valuable for
  the current codebase. You may decide to have a standard Ruby set of
  conventions for all Ruby code in your organization, but on one project you
  might make minor overrides to the standard because of the type of codebase
  it might be. Perhaps it's a crypto/security library and some extra
  constraints would be important because of how the Ruby bindings interface
  with the native C code. (That example may or may not make sense.)
</p>
<p>
  With one mind and agreement a team can work together and not constantly
  fight with each other over minor details that in the grand scheme of things
  don't really matter. For example, I might say the difference between two
  space indentation and four space indentation is more a personal preference.
  However, the difference between four and eight space indentation potentially
  has readability impat for the team to consider. I personally use two space
  indentation for most languages except Python where four is the commonly
  accepted PEP8 standard for the community. If I joined a Ruby project that
  used four space indentation I would not make a stink about it. It is just
  an agreement in the team. It's not personal. We should move on to the
  more interesting engineering problems in such a case.
</p>
<blockquote>
  All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
</blockquote>
<p>
  All families must make compromises to continue functioning well. The agree-
  ment on code conventions and/or styleguides plus the changes workflow
  itself should be documented, well defined, and easy to update when needed.
</p>
<p>
  Things happen. People join and people leave. Treat the team's agreement
  as a living breathing document and set of principles to adhere by. Talk
  about things at lunch some times. What irks you about the conventions, why?
  How would you change it? Make a case to the rest of the team. Decide. As a
  team.
</p>
<p>
  The changes workflow (e.g. git and/or release workflow, etc.) needs to be
  well defined and documented. Unless it is contraversial, I don't think
  the initial agreement has to be democratically elected because that might
  take a while.
</p>
<p>
  As an initial step, I strongly suggest you use the default language code
  style guidelines when creating new teams and/or codebases. Then iterate.
  Otherwise you will spent an enternity arguing over an empty canvas. If
  there are multiple, put the top three already existing public ones up for a
  vote to the team. But make sure it is a living and breathing document that
  can be updated and revisited.
</p>
<h3>5. People Are Burned Out</h3>
<p>
  There are potentially many reasons for this, but the root cause is usually
  ineffective executive management who constantly fail to drive meaningful
  changes through their organization. Instead what is common is buzzword
  bingo during All Hands meetings and empty promises that are never delivered
  on.
</p>
<p>
  When this happens you can see management decisions are not based on
  meaningful metrics; these are discarded in favor of pomp and fanfare
  numbers without context to drive decisions. Decisions based on their deep
  seated biases and their strongly held belief that as long as they look good
  nothing (and maybe nobody) else matters.
</p>
<p>
  This is the biggest problem in this list. Without cleaning house, nothing
  can fix this. Executives must believe that using metrics meaningfully with
  context and not just for the gamification of their peons against each other
  is a valuable proposition that will lead to a more effective organization
  with less headaches (for them).
