          <h2>Stupid Easy: 7 Deadly [Rails] Sins, Part 1</h2>
          Everyone has been talking about Rails for a few of years now as the framework that makes it "stupid easy" to create web applications.  The problem I have with this mentality is it creates a "stupid easy" sub-culture within the Rails community that promotes stupid laziness (as opposed to smart laziness).
Over the last 3 Rails contracts, I have worked with supposedly experienced developers that have switched to Rails from OO languages like Java and C++ (as opposed to pretend OO languages like PHP).  The results have been VERY disappointing.
The biggest problem I see is that some, even quite experienced developers, have the [stupid] lazy mentality burned into their brains.  They want to visit blogs and copy and paste code into their applications without thinking about it.  In fact, recently I found a ridiculous real world example of such madness.  No thought put into the pasted code AT ALL.  I could identify the blog posting on a popular Rails blog that had the EXACT same code.  The variables weren't EVEN renamed to be meaningful in the current application.  Instead a finance web application had references to customers and invoices in the controller and view code when there were no such entities/models involved in the application.  Not only is this a maintenance nightmare, it show how little thought went into the code just to get a small AJAX effect that (a) wasn't difficult to write from scratch (4 lines in total after refactoring from the 11 lines of code used) and (b) was probably not even that necessary from the user experience perspective.
These are the developers I think ought to return to their no-thinking PHP or Java/JEE recipe books and leave the Ruby world alone.  Of course, the authors of "recipe" books should also bare some of the blame for encouraging the no-thinking hackers out there to join the Ruby world in the first place.  Is that really the type of mindset we wish to harbor in our community?
Look at the PHP and Java universes today for a reference point of where we will end up very soon if we are not careful.
<h4>1. Stupid Easy Schemas</h4>
One of the deadly sins I saw on my travels through their code was extending the "stupid easy" mentality in the form of not defining schema properly.  Sure they *used* Rails' migrations, but they didn't really create a usable schema based on the use stories and cross-story functional requirements.
While you might not want to use database specific features like triggers, stored procedures, or even foreign keys (the latter assumes you are using Rails-based equivalents in place of FKs), you should still make your schema sensible.
For example,
<pre><code>
# Migration code
  create_table :countries do |t|
    t.column :code, :string
    t.column :name, :string
  end

# Model code
class Country  3
    t.column :name, :string # You may even decide to cap the length of the name field too, but this is more of a DBA style thing.
  end
  add_index :countries, :code, :unique =&gt; true

# Model code
class Country  3
  validates_uniqueness_of :code
end






















# in SparksController
  def check_permissions
    return false unless current_user.has_permission?(:MANAGE_USERS)
    true
  end











</code></pre>
