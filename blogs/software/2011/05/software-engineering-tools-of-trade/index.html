          <h2>Software Engineering: Tools of the Trade</h2>
          <h3></h3>
          <p>
  While contemplating everything that software engineering encompasses during several conversations concerning
  Computer Science education reform (my notes and thoughts coming soon, promise), I was asked what tools should be
  taught and why. So below is a brief overview of the tools that have helped me be a better software engineer
  over the years and why.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <code>emacs</code> <em>and</em> <code>vi(m)</code>: Let the student decide for themselves.
    I am naturally strongly right-handed, but in editor choice I am, you could say, ambidexterous.
    I have alternated between <em>emacs</em> and <em>vi(m)</em> on 1-3 year irregular cycles since
    first typing <code>vi</code> in the SunOS lab at university. This excludes a 2-3 years dark
    age in my development career while heavily engrossed in Java/J2EE/JEE and all
    things <em>"enterprisey"</em>. During this phase I must confess to using a new IDE every other
    month because I couldn't get confortable with one. It was at the end of this uncreative period
    of my career that I realized the importance of getting back to editor basics with something like
    <em>emacs</em> or <em>vim</em>. I am currently in a <em>vim</em> cycle that started about 10
    months ago.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make</code>: Laugh if you must. I have used many build tools that are fantastic
    in very specific environments, but as soon as you veer off of its well manicured path
    you fall into trouble. Make (I refer to GNU make or any mostly compatible derivative)
    is most widely supported and truly versatile build tool around.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>gdb</code> (or other language command line debuggers): debugging from the command-line
    forces me to form a more complete mental map of the codebase I am stepping through.
    It is also, on rare but noteworthy occasions, a necessary evil in production headless systems
    (not for the faint of heart and certainly not to be used unless absolutely necessary).
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>UNIX/Linux</code> commands/utilities: Everything from awk to zipgrep (everything in between
    plus I am sure things outside of that range too), including sed, awk, grep, cut, xargs, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    A <code>UNIX/Linux</code> shell (of your choice): I started on Bourne shell because that was
    the default on SunOS when I started using the computer lab for my software development
    (non-commercial) endeavours at university. Then migrated to Bash (Bourne Again SHell) after
    installing Linux on my own computers in the mid/late-1990s. I remained on Bash for a number
    of years before migrating to Zsh. Really getting intimate with various shells impressed
    upon me the importance of knowing your tools well. When I have known my shell deeply I have
    found lots of ways to save myself a lot of time on repetitive tasks using simple scripts, aliases
    or autocomplete configuration.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Git:</code> Out of all the tools of the trade that I use (and sometimes abuse) this one,
    I am sure, will irritate the lonely Subversion fan or holier-than-thou Mercurial zealot. Fine.
    I do not come to convert you, rather I mention this as the tool that has influenced my thoughts
    the most on development workflows. Period. In 2006 I was still happily plodding along using
    Subvesion in a centralized repository workflow. After the first half of 2007 past I truly
    had an epiphany about how many options there were for distributed workflows and all the
    possibilities. Git had arrived in my life and it was here to stay. If you do not know what all
    the fuss is about, don't worry I am not sure 98% of the fanboys ranting about it realize either.
    The key to remember isn't necessarily Git, but distributed version control systems (dVCS). Git
    just happened to be the first dVCS that I truly had to understand. I had submitted a patch via
    Darcs on an open source project years ago, but I didn't really appreciate what "distributed"
    repositories really offered until I had to incorporate a distribute workflow using Git at work.
    Try it!
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>LaTeX:</code> Yeah, I know you are thinking "@#$(%(#*@". I get it. Perhaps it is because
    I had to write my final year thesis in it, but I have rediscovered its beauty within the last
    year and I wonder why I ever bothered with Word and Powerpoint (or open source equivalents).
    LaTeX rules them all with superior and far more flexible typesetting. So much so that it
    astonishes me more people do not use it. Now that I am presenting more at conferences as well
    as to potential investors I can't live without it.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The common thread of all these tools is the ability for me to get back to basics without the
  clutter and danger of "pretty".
