          %h3 Overview

%p
  My Twitter timeline this morning went crazy with references to the 
  %a{:href =&gt; "http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-pointer-00"} JSON Pointer
  draft proposal or specification (and the 
  %a{:href =&gt; "https://github.com/janl/erl-jsonpointer"} Erlang JSON Pointer 
  implementation on GitHub by janl). I was all excited for all of two minutes as I 
  read the couple of non-boilerplate paragraphs in the JSON Pointer spec draft.

%p
  The problem is that it doesn't appear to return all matching nodes in the 
  JSON document representation tree for a given "pointer". Let us look at a 
  few examples.

%h3 JSON Pointer Examples

%p 
  Let us pretend that we have this JSON document:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1117626.js"> </script>

%p
  Now let us say we want all the names of actors from this movie 
  (OK, it is a spoof trailer, but I might watch it if they did make it).
  We would need to access each one by index like so:

%ul
  %li 
    %code /actors/1/name
  %li
    %code /actors/2/name
  %li
    %code /actors/3/name
  %li
    %code /actors/4/name
  %li
    %code /actors/5/name

%p
  This is really very inelegant and verbose (not to mention pretty
  inefficient) to use JSON Pointers to look these names up one by one.

%p
  Now let us suppose that instead of the JSON document only holding the 
  details of one movie, it contains a list of movies in a category. Now 
  when we do <code>/actors/X/name</code> (where X is a valid index for 
  the first movie in the list) we retrieve the Xth actor name for the 
  first movie (as per the spec draft linked to earlier). How droll!

%h3 Enter XPath

%p
  I know it isn't fashionable to like anything XML related any more, but
  there are some things that XML brought that are quite useful. One is
  (IMHO) XPath.

%p
  I first came across XPath 7-8 years ago when building a canonical 
  <abbr title="Object Oriented">OO</abbr> model of a broad set of 
  financial products spanning many asset classes that would represent
  (eventually) every financial product of varying complexity using the 
  same fundamental modeling building blocks (not a small feat - and not 
  sure it ever realized its full objective, but anyhoo...). (A subset of) 
  XPath was being use to query the rich object model (often represented 
  as XML at the periphery of the system i.e. at integration endpoints). 
  This may have been one of the bigger successes of the project. XPath 
  demonstrated its value by the following characteristics:

%ul
  %li 
    being flexible: it is able to describe a number of "paths" of data 
    representation.
  %li 
    being descriptive: most people can read an XPath and most of the time 
    understand what data it will access.
  %li 
    being representation agnostic: allowing clients to use XPath on either 
    a fully realized object representation or an unparsed XML document 
    (the runtime could be lazy when it made sense to be)

%p
  You might be wondering how XPath is flexible? Well despite my appreciation 
  of the JSON Pointer draft spec being pretty short to read, the XPath spec 
  describes ways to start matching in mid path (by adding an extra '/' as 
  prefix), to select the parent of a matching node (by appending '..' to 
  XPath), to select attributes (by prepending '@' to attribute name in the 
  XPath - ok, not so useful, perhaps in a JSON document) as well as the 
  ability to use a number of predicates (e.g. last(), position(), index 
  numbers, &gt;, &lt;). However, the key differentiator of XPath over JSON 
  Pointer isn't all these extra path describing features, it is that it 
  returns a result set of all elements (or values) that match the given 
  selector.

%p
  Let us look at what would be returned using the JSON document of the 
  movie above with the following XPaths:

%ul
  %li 
    %code //actors/name =&gt; ["Scala Johansson", "William Windows", ..., "Lenny Linux"]
  %li
    %code title =&gt; ["Java 4-ever"]
  %li
    %code //actors/character =&gt; ["A", "B", "C", "D", "C (Young)"]
  %li
    %code //actors[2]/character =&gt; ["C"]

%p
  As we can see this provides a lot of flexibility. Now if we had a JSON 
  document that contained movie documents like this under a subtree then 
  the above XPaths would still select what we want.

%p
  The above examples only touched the surface of XPath, but I think it 
  already demonstrated how much more flexible it would be applied to 
  JSON documents.

%h3 Great, but what is the point, Susan?

%p
  Not sure I can really say there is a lot of point to this post other than 
  griping and moaning about the lack of a good selector language for JSON 
  documents currently. However, if anyone else feels that an XPath subset 
  that is relevant to applying to JSON documents and would like to work with 
  me to distill such a useable subset into a draft/proposal (or whatever), 
  then 
  %a{:href =&gt; "/contact"} contact me
  so we can get the ball rolling. Even HTML has a decent way to select elements 
  ("values") in the DOM to be able to apply styles or behavio(u)r.
