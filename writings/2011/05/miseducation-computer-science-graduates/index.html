          <h2>The Miseducation of Computer Science Graduates (in US)</h2>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
  This is a draft of my critiques (hopefully constructive) on the topic of 
  <em>Computer Science</em> education in post-high school level institutions, 
  specifically research universities (in the United States as this is with 
  what I have experience).
</p>
<p>
  I hope to point out systemic deficiencies as far as I see them, as someone 
  who has hired Computer Science graduates for my consulting clients and soon 
  (I hope) for my new business venture when I get all my funding ducks in a 
  row. The purpose of this draft (so far) is to help sort through my thoughts 
  on the issues at hand, and potentially offer constructive suggestions for 
  educators to test out in the lecture hall or computer lab (after revising 
  my statements to more accurately depict my suggestions). It is not to point 
  the finger at specific people, those with certain job titles or students. 
  We are all in this together.
</p>

<p>
  I hope the draft isn't too rough for people to read through so they can 
  provide feedback, because I want this to be interactive and constructive
  for everyone. Not simply a venting platform for me. If it is let me know.
</p>

<h3>Motivations</h3>

<p>
  My motivations are, undeniably, selfish. They are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
    I want to be able to hire <acronym title="Computer Science">CS</acronym>
    graduates that can be productive on day one instead of spending a good 
    amount of time introducing them to aspects of software engineering I 
    had hoped would be covered in their undergraduate degrees.
  </li>
  <li>
    I also want to continue being able to live in a country that wil be 
    economically competitive such that at least some creative jobs remain 
    here for the rest of my career instead of being forced to lift up my 
    roots to relocate somewhere I <em>may</em> not care to live just to 
    satisfy my professional goals (of course, I may choose instead to 
    wither and die professionally in a less competitive economy where 
    only boring support jobs exist). Neither of these potential outcomes 
    appeal to me. If you are reading this from a developing economy thinking, 
    <em>"what an arrogant westerner"</em> you would be correct. I haven't
    spent much of my life outside of western cultures, only the first 
    seven years of it. As hard as it is to see a westerners point of view 
    at least acknowledge that if you were in my shoes and had started your 
    career in more creative, innovative positions that the you would also 
    not look forward to a career that ends with dull, unchallenging 
    support roles as I <em>should</em> be increasing in position, title, 
    and salary if previous career trajectories are anything to go by. (Of 
    course, they aren't but that is another matter entirely.)
  </li>
  <li>
    As a new parent now I hope educational reform will take place to better 
    equip my child in the future.
  </li>
</ol>
<!--
<p>
  It should also be noted that there are the general motivations of students
  in play too. As well as <strong>general</strong> motivations of those 
  teaching Computer Science in higher education institutions.
</p>

<p>
  I obviously cannot speak for everyone, but I imagine the primary motivation 
  of students entering into a Computer Science degree would be to get into a 
  career related to this subject matter and to make themselves more marketable
  in comparison to those who enter the job market without <acronym 
    title="Computer Science">CS</acronym> degrees. In the US, a student entering
  into an undergraduate degree can expect, on average (assuming their parents 
  can't pay for it out of pocket), to be in debt approximately $23,000 by the 
  time they finish *if* they go to a public school [1]. This does make things 
  more complicated as I will try to make a case later that CS degrees today 
  are well taught if the objective is to train budding Computer scientists for 
  an academic career, not well suited to train software, hardware or firmware 
  engineers of the future for industry (without a lot more training and 
  conditioning of the graduate by their first employer after college).
</p>

<p>
  Because the average undergraduate debt increases every year at a rate much 
  higher than inflation it wouldn't be unreasonable for new graduates to expect 
  starting salaries to be higher to compensate for their debt. The sad truth is 
  I suspect (based on conversations with a number of new CS graduates) the 
  starting salaries are decreasing (in proportion at least to how much tuition 
  and undergraduate debt levels increases year on year).
</p>

<p>
  In terms of the motivations of the faculty teaching Computer Science programming 
  courses, I would first like to point out that there are good, OK and bad 
  teachers throughout academia in every subject. I am not going to talk about 
  teaching quality as I find there to be a huge variance of this in higher 
  education especially in the research-oriented universities. Teaching quality is 
  also not the systemic issue I find to be the problem w.r.t. Computer Science 
  higher education. I will discuss the issues I perceive in terms of course 
  content, the way it is taught (again not related to teaching quality, but order 
  of delivery of the content) and other areas not related to motivations later.
  However, it would be incomplete of me not to mention that there seems to be 
  a growing conflict <strong>due to no fault of the teaching faculty</strong> 
  arising in higher education today (at least in US) that should be pointed out.
</p>

<p>
  First consider that getting faculty positions, even in the area of Computer 
  Science, is very competitive. It is made even more pronounced as higher 
  education institutions are facing major budget cuts across the United States 
  today impacting not just public (state funded) colleges, but also private 
  universities as federal research grants are becoming even more competitive. 
  This means faculty need to spend more time writing grant proposals to bring 
  in as much money to their department as possible. Second consider the process 
  of tenure-track positions on faculty. There is a much greater emphasis in many 
  departments when considering tenure on journal articles or books published than 
  teaching accomplishments, especially in research oriented universities. Both of 
  these conflict for time resources of any faculty member teaching CS undergraduate 
  courses. This is just reality. Even faculty that truly care about teaching their 
  students all they can, this is just the new reality. This is a systemic issue.
